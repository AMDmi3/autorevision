== NAME ==
autorevision - extract head metadata from version-control repositories

== SYNOPSIS ==
*autorevision* {-t output-type} [-o cache-file] [-s variable] [-V]

== DESCRIPTION ==
*autorevision* extracts metadata about the head version of your repository.

This program is meant to be used by project build systems to extract
properties that can be used in software version strings. It can emit
source files containing variable and macro definitions suitable for
use with C, C++, sh, Python, Perl, and Mac info.plist files.

The generated source is written to standard output. 

If you specify a cache file, then when *autorevision* is run where no
repository can be recognized, the values from the cache file will be
used instead.  If a repository can be recognized, the cache is
rewritten. This feature makes it possible for your build to run
from an unpacked tarball that includes the cache file.

The following repository types will be automatically recognized:

*Git*: A version greater than 1.7.2.3 is recommended.

*Mercurial*: A version greater than 1.6 is recommended.

*Subversion*: Any production version

The following output types may be specified:

*h*::
A header file suitable for C/C++.

*xcode*::
A header output for use with xcode to populate info.plist strings.

*sh*::
A text file suitable for including from a bash script

*py*::
A Python source file setting Python variables.

*pl*::
A Perl source file setting Perl variables.

Each generated source file defines the following symbols:

*VCS_TYPE*::
The repository type - "git", "hg", or "svn".

*VCS_NUM*::
A count of revisions between the current one and the initial
one; useful for reporting build numbers.

*VCS_DATE*::
The date of the most recent commit in true ISO-8601/RFC3339
format, including seconds.

*VCS_URI*::
Repository dependent: for Git the full refspec, for Mercurial
the bookmark or the branch if there is no bookmark, empty for Subversion.

*VCS_TAG*::
The current tag, or a synonym for `VCS_URI` if not currently on a tag.
Empty under Subversion

*VCS_FULL_HASH*::
A full unique identifier for the current revision.

*VCS_SHORT_HASH*::
A shortened version VCS_FULL_HASH, but VCS_FULL_HASH
if it cannot be shortened.

*VCS_WC_MODIFIED*::
Set to 1 if the current working directory has been
modified and 0 if not. If the output language has native Boolean
literals, true will mean modified and false unmodified.

== OPTIONS ==

The -t option sets the output type. It is required unless -s is
specified; both -t and -s cannot be used in the same invocation.

The -o option sets he name of the cache file.

The -s option changes the reporting behavior; instead of emitting
a symbol file to stdout, only the value of that individual variable
will be reported. It is required unless -t is specified; both -t
and -s cannot be used in the same invocation.

The -V option emits the autorevision version and exits.
